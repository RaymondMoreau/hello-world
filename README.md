PRACTICE ON MAKING RESPOSITORIES

So this is my first file from my first year in university. I know html java js and whatever but i haven't even dealt with the real world of coding yet. 
University better be worth all the money and SELF-LEARNING man this is such a scam but u cannot get a job without the stupid certification paper.
Currently I'm watching Casey Li Lectures and now I'm off just on GitHub. My brain is wandering. TFT season 4 fates just came out and the guys finally got Among Us yesterday. It makes me pretty happy cus now I can finally play it with them. I sure did slack off today just watching youtube videos and waking up at 2pm again ahahahaha oh well. I will grind more tommorow to make up for it.
My two first friends of university are Jacob Jasniewicz and Ashton Hagar. They're pretty cool, though I don't know them well. I hope the rest of the year goes smoothly with them to help me, though I feel bad for taking their help all the time and want to help them back. I guess that's how friendship works eh?
I'm only writing this because maybe someday future Raymond who is more successful because of university student Raymond's grinding will come back to his roots and read this. Live back some of the nostalgia. Maybe this will never be looked at again. Who knows.
Now that I've said it, this kind of feels weird to write. As if I need to make it special. Like this is my final message to someone.
All I gotta say is futuremond PLEASE do not slack off. Get assignments done right away and don't fall behind in anything you're doing. It piles up and you and just makes you feel like shit. no cap man
Well, I need to get back to watching Casey Li lectures now so goodbye I guess. If I'm reading this from the future then I hope u finally pick your wife and enjoy the next 30 years with her and maybe a couple of kids until you get old. Until then, I guess I will stay lonely. Sounds sad, doesn't it?

Goodbye and I wish you the best.

Remember to text sam riley and ethan!


Just a P.S, if anyone who isn't me is reading this somehow... (cus i know this is a public sharing site ish?) just pretend like u never read this. I'm too lazy to put it at the top plus if you read this segment then you'd forget it by the end. You'd also not be erred by it and submit to your self conscious curiosity of what lies in the mountain of text ahead. So I'm saying it here. Just keep it to yourself. Thanks :)

Goodbye for real this time



for real
